<h1 align="center">My Story</h1>
My interest in tech started the summer before high school as a counselor for McMaster Venture camp, teaching circuitry, soldering, and basic programming to kids.<br><br>

I was inspired to take Computer Science courses in grade 10, where I learned Python. Over winter break I began using PyGame, a python library for simple graphics, to craft my first *real* programming project: a basic twin stick top-down arena shooter game with different classes of enemies and attacks, an explorable overworld map with a dozen missions, and a shop to upgrade your arsenal with your spoils of war. God I wish I still had that code.<br><br>

In grade 11 I learned web design, and also took Computer Engineering: a course based half on hardware, and half on software. Once again, a personal project sparked my interest in code. With a small team of friends, I built a small remote control car out of plastic pieces, the old motor off another rc car, breadboards, an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and *webcam*. Powered by Arduino, Processing, and mIRC (Microsoft Internet Relay Chat), the car could stream its POV to Twitch and accept input through the live Twitch chat. Another project I wish I still had the code to.<br><br>

Grade 12 was focused on OOP concepts and teamwork, and once I learned OOP I could never go back. I fondly remember a project from this time where teams would compete to write AI for a competitive BattleBots style videogame in which each team consists of 4 bots with individual health, movement, and identical AIs running separately. At the end of the project, the teacher pit the teams against each other in a battle royal where the best AI team wins. Good times.<br><br>

I came to Ontario Tech as a game development student hoping to learn game engine tech, and eventually transferred programs into computer science. Now I spend my days coding silly little bots and side projects :>
